# tland
Taskwarrior landscape

# NAME
tland.pl - Taskwarrior landscape

# SYNOPSIS
perl tland.pl \[2d|3w|2m\]

# DESCRIPTION
Identifying and telling apart tasks by dates in the output of a Taskwarrior list command is somewhat difficult for me, so I use this script to simplify it.  It shows the tasks due for each day clearly separated, AM/PM divided, and every day/week/month shown in a explicit way.
